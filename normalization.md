## Normalization Steps
1. First Normal Form (1NF) - Eliminate Repeating Groups
Initial Issue: The database design already satisfies 1NF as all attributes contain atomic values with no repeating groups.

Action Taken: No changes needed for 1NF compliance.

2. Second Normal Form (2NF) - Remove Partial Dependencies
Initial Issues Identified:

The Property entity contains location information that could be normalized

The User entity contains role information that could be normalized
